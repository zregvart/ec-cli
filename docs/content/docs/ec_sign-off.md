## ec sign-off

Capture signed off signatures from a source (github repo, Jira)

### Synopsis

Supported sign off sources are commits captured from a git repo and jira issues.
               The git sources return a signed off value and the git commit. The jira issue is
			   a TODO, but will return the Jira issue with any sign off values.
